# Router-Reverse-Engineering-And-Backdooring
Reverse engineering is the process of decompiling a product to expose itâ€™s internal architecture and learn how it was built. Router firmwares are mostly in binary format since they are hardware specific and cannot be read. Therefore, they are reverse engineered to decompress the file system present in it.
